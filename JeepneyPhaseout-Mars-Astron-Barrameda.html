		<p style="margin-right: 166px; margin-left: 166px ;font-size: 23px; font-family: Times New Roman; text-align: justify">With the deadline for a mandated phase-out of jeepney minibuses looming on January 1, drivers of the Philippines’ most iconic public transport vehicle held a mass strike and demonstration in the capital of Manila and other cities on Friday demanding the government change course.</p>

		<p style="margin-right: 166px; margin-left: 166px ;font-size: 23px; font-family: Times New Roman; text-align: justify">But President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr has stood firm on his December 12 decision to enforce the phase-out’s deadline, writing on social media that it would “not be moved”.</p>

		<p style="margin-right: 166px; margin-left: 166px ;font-size: 23px;font-family: Times New Roman; text-align: justify">Because “70 per cent of all operators have already committed to and consolidated under the Public Utility Vehicle Modernisation Programme (PUVMP). We cannot let the minority cause further delays,” Marcos Jnr wrote in a post on social media platform X. </p>

		<p style="margin-right: 166px; margin-left: 166px ;font-size: 23px;	font-family: Times New Roman; text-align: justify">When the programme goes into effect on Monday, all traditional jeepneys that are at least 15 years old will lose their government-issued franchises and will no longer be able to operate legally as public utility transport.</p>

		<p style="margin-right: 166px; margin-left: 166px ;font-size: 23px; font-family: Times New Roman; text-align: justify">When the programme goes into effect on Monday, all 41,918 of the country’s traditional jeepneys will lose their government-issued franchises to operate as public transportation. However, temporary permits to continue operating will be provided to owners who tell the government by Sunday that they will take part in the PUVMP’s “consolidation programme” by joining or forming cooperatives to acquire modern Public Utility Vehicles (PUVs).</p>

		<p style="margin-right: 166px; margin-left: 166px ;font-size: 23px; font-family: Times New Roman; text-align: justify"> The benefits of a jeepney phaseout include reducing excessive emissions of harmful gases, improving the environment, and enhancing the health of commuters. </p>
		<p style="margin-right: 166px; margin-left: 166px ;font-size: 23px; font-family: Times New Roman; text-align: justify">Additionally, phasing out jeepneys with poor emissions can contribute to sustainable development by improving the quality of life, maintaining the natural environment, and honoring local culture.</p>
		<p style="margin-right: 166px; margin-left: 166px ;font-size: 23px; font-family: Times New Roman; text-align: justify">It can also lead to the development of more efficient and sustainable modes of public transportation, such as e-Jeepneys, which are accessible, safe, and environmentally friendly.</p>
		<p style="margin-right: 166px; margin-left: 166px ;font-size: 23px; font-family: Times New Roman; text-align: justify">Furthermore, a phaseout can address the challenges faced by jeepney drivers during the pandemic and provide opportunities for alternative transportation solutions.</p>
		<p style="margin-right: 166px; margin-left: 166px ;font-size: 23px; font-family: Times New Roman; text-align: justify">However, it is important to consider the cultural significance and value of jeepneys in Filipino society, as they are not only a mode of transportation but also an icon of Filipino culture and identity.</p>

		<p style="margin-right: 166px; margin-left: 166px ;font-size: 23px; font-family: Times New Roman; text-align: justify">The phase-out of jeepneys in the Philippines has significant economic impacts. The government's Jeepney Modernization program aims to replace old regular jeepneys with modernized ones, which has led to challenges and repercussions. The program involves the implementation of new policies, vehicle modernization, operator consolidation, and changes in the current business model.</p>
		<p style="margin-right: 166px; margin-left: 166px ;font-size: 23px; font-family: Times New Roman; text-align: justify">This large-scale initiative is expected to bring about comprehensive reform in the land-based public transport sector, which is predominantly composed of jeepneys. However, the transition from an informal model to a more formalized one may disrupt the current system. The phase-out of jeepneys also raises concerns about the livelihood of jeepney operators and drivers.</p>
		<p style="margin-right: 166px; margin-left: 166px ;font-size: 23px; font-family: Times New Roman; text-align: justify">Additionally, the poor quality and insufficient transport infrastructure in Metro Manila contribute to daily economic losses for the nation. Mitigating road congestion through methods like adding mass transit infrastructure or implementing policy changes is challenging. Ride-hailing services have been considered as a potential solution, but their impact on traffic conditions and environmental, social, and economic factors needs to be carefully assessed</p>

		<p style="margin-right: 166px; margin-left: 166px ;font-size: 23px; font-family: Times New Roman; text-align: justify">MANILA, Philippines — Modern jeepneys would cost P1.6 million to P2.4 million, and drivers would need to earn around P6,000 to P7,000 a day if they should acquire it, a lawmaker said Wednesday.</p>

		<p style="margin-right: 166px; margin-left: 166px ;font-size: 23px; font-family: Times New Roman; text-align: justify">1-Rider Party-list Rep. Bonifacio Bosita also warned that for drivers and operators to pay off their modernized jeepney loans, base fares may rise between P30 and P40 based on his computations – even with the government’s subsidy considered.</p>

		<p style="margin-right: 166px; margin-left: 166px ;font-size: 23px; font-family: Times New Roman; text-align: justify">During the hearing of the House committee on transportation, Bosita asked the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), particularly Chairman Teofilo Guadiz III, several times about the cost of updated jeepneys under the Public Utility Vehicle Modernization Program (PUVMP).</p>

		<p style="margin-right: 166px; margin-left: 166px ;font-size: 23px; font-family: Times New Roman; text-align: justify">His question stemmed from his worry that drivers may not meet the required loan payments for modern jeepneys.</p>

		<p style="margin-right: 166px; margin-left: 166px ;font-size: 23px; font-family: Times New Roman; text-align: justify">As a student who studies in Manila and who lives far from the university, I tend to wake up early in the morning with concern for the hustle and bustle of the city, specifically the commuting. Throughout my experience as a student who commutes every day, my saving grace against the fear of missing out and being late for classes has been jeepneys.</p>

		<p style="margin-right: 166px; margin-left: 166px ;font-size: 23px; font-family: Times New Roman; text-align: justify">With their accessibility on the roads, jeepneys became one of my preferred types of transportation, which also became a witness to my journey as a student and as an individual.</p>

		<p style="margin-right: 166px; margin-left: 166px ;font-size: 23px; font-family: Times New Roman; text-align: justify">Jeepneys are embedded in our culture and also in our experiences as commuters–well, for me, if not for others. Thus, here are the reasons why jeepneys should not be phased out:</p>

		<strong><p style="margin-right: 166px; margin-left: 166px ;font-size: 30px; font-family: Times New Roman; text-align: justify; font-style: italic;">Contribution to Filipino identity</p></strong>

		<p style="margin-right: 166px; margin-left: 166px ;font-size: 23px; font-family: Times New Roman; text-align: justify">Historically, jeepneys are the products of damages from World War II. As the then cable cars were completely ruined because of all the bombings in the city, local manufacturers modified and altered them to accommodate more passengers and to mobilize the urban population of the country.</p>

		<p style="margin-right: 166px; margin-left: 166px ;font-size: 23px; font-family: Times New Roman; text-align: justify">Even though it was considered a temporary solution to wake the people after the destruction of the war, jeepneys eventually became a cultural symbol of the country as they became fundamental to the lives of every Filipino, especially commuters.</p>

		<p style="margin-right: 166px; margin-left: 166px ;font-size: 23px; font-family: Times New Roman; text-align: justify"><p style="margin-right: 166px; margin-left: 166px ;font-size: 23px; font-family: Times New Roman; text-align: justify">Soon after, jeepneys were hailed as the ‘Hari ng Kalsada’ for their festive designs and vibrant colors, along with their roaring engine sounds, which befit the loud ornaments and designs that they have.</p>

		<p style="margin-right: 166px; margin-left: 166px ;font-size: 23px; font-family: Times New Roman; text-align: justify">As it became iconic, you couldn't see a single tourist who didn't seem amused and charmed by jeepneys. Known as the backbone of Filipino transportation, it became a part of the Filipino landscape, culture, and identity as it became the symbol and source of pride for Filipinos.</p>

		<strong><p style="margin-right: 166px; margin-left: 166px ;font-size: 30px; font-family: Times New Roman; text-align: justify; font-style: italic;">Least advantage to the environment</p></strong>

		<p style="margin-right: 166px; margin-left: 166px ;font-size: 23px; font-family: Times New Roman; text-align: justify">One of the goals of the modernization program is to lessen the air pollution. Yet, it is important to take note that jeepneys only constitute 2 percent of all the registered vehicles in the country.</p>

		<p style="margin-right: 166px; margin-left: 166px ;font-size: 23px; font-family: Times New Roman; text-align: justify">As most Filipinos can’t afford to purchase their own vehicles, they are forced to use jeepneys, which fit their purpose of accommodating a large number of passengers.</p>

		<p style="margin-right: 166px; margin-left: 166px ;font-size: 23px; font-family: Times New Roman; text-align: justify">With this, it reduces traffic, prohibits more greenhouse emissions, and reduces air pollution. In numbers, singling out jeepneys for traffic jams, road accidents, and carbon emissions won’t alter the problem of air pollution.</p>
		<center><img src="https://forum.playhive.com/uploads/default/original/3X/e/3/e3c70807400482bf0d7c7b1ba16822f12ad9e888.jpeg"style="border: solid; height: 464px; width: 696;box-shadow: 5px 10px #888888;"></center>
		<strong><p style="margin-right: 166px; margin-left: 166px ;font-size: 30px; font-family: Times New Roman; text-align: justify; font-style: italic;">Phaseout’s burden to transport workers</p></strong>

		<p style="margin-right: 166px; margin-left: 166px ;font-size: 23px; font-family: Times New Roman; text-align: justify">With the recent calls for the halt of phaseout, one of the concerns that the PUV drivers are screaming about is the financial burden of the modernization program.</p>

		<p style="margin-right: 166px; margin-left: 166px ;font-size: 23px; font-family: Times New Roman; text-align: justify">Modern jeepneys approximately cost P2.8 million, at least for the year 2023, while traditional jeepneys cost P200,000 to P400,000. This amount will be shouldered by the operators and jeepney drivers, which exceeds the financial capacity of a normal ‘tsuper’ who only depends on their earnings from driving a jeepney.</p>

		<p style="margin-right: 166px; margin-left: 166px ;font-size: 23px; font-family: Times New Roman; text-align: justify">Furthermore, the phase-out doesn’t only affect the transport workers but also the commuters, as the accommodation for thousands of passengers in a day won’t be enough. Also, the privatization of the traditional jeepneys will result in fare hikes, which will affect students and minimum wage-earner Filipinos.</p>

		<p style="margin-right: 166px; margin-left: 166px ;font-size: 23px; font-family: Times New Roman; text-align: justify">Modernization is constant and necessary, yet resonating with our experiences and transport workers’ livelihoods, jeepneys should not be completely eradicated from the roads. Find a middle ground where they can assure the livelihood of the drivers and operators while certifying the safety, comfort, and welfare of commuters.</p>

		<p style="margin-right: 166px; margin-left: 166px ;font-size: 23px; font-family: Times New Roman; text-align: justify">Looking at the two sides of the coin, aside from the livelihood of local transport workers, it will also erase the profound culture of the country. The culture that once brought vibrant experiences and identity to Filipinos, which should be carried all throughout the constant changes of time.</p>
